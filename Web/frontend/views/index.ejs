   <br>
Food spoilage is the number one leading cause of food waste, according to rts.com. 
<br>
Other considerable factors include:
<br>
- confusing labels,
<br>
- oversized servings and containers,
<br>
- and more…
<br>

<br>
<br>
KitchIN was created to solve these exact problems. With KitchIN, you and your family, roommates, or significant other can manage, track, and efficiently make use of food in your household.
<br>
<br>
KitchIN allows you to easily keep track of your food inventory, allowing three methods of adding items to your household:
<br>
<br>
1. Image Recognition: Simply take a picture of your fridge and our AI will detect probable foods, suggest them and allow you to easily add them to your virtual household
<br>
<br>
2. Barcode Scanning: Simply scan the barcode of an item, and add! See nutrition facts, quantity, and more!
<br>
<br>
3. Manual Input: Got takeout? Maybe leftovers? No worries, simply add it yourself!
<br>
<br>
KitchIN also utilizes the power of ChatGPT 3.5 Turbo, to provide an assistant to answer your nutritional needs! Wonder what meals can be made with ingredients in your fridge? KitchIN AI can help assist you.
<br>
<br>
Now let’s say you don’t have all the ingredients… with the Instacart API, you can simply checkout and have it delivered to your home address, all without leaving the comfort of your home. This ensures you only buy what you need, when you need it.
<br>
<br>
Prefer going out and shopping? No problem. Making grocery lists is a thing of the past. Forgot how much cheese you have at home? What about if you have any spinach left? What about those eggs you bought two months ago? Or was it two weeks… We are all busy and have a lot going on, allow KitchIN to remember what is and isn’t in your household, so you can worry about what and what not to buy!
